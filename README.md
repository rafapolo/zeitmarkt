## zeitmarkt

As part of the Gütermarkt project at the ZKU (Zentrum für Kunst und Urbanistik in Berlin) Alex Head, Rafael Polo and Jolanda Todt are exploring the early stages of setting up a timebank platform, creating an initial network of users from the services and products available at the Gütermarkt.

A time bank is a system of currency where the unit of exchange is the person-hour. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an hour of service from another volunteer.

Zeitbank can been seen as the complementary opposite to the Gütermarkt. We are looking for ways to explore that which is opposite to the market: not products, offers and services - but the desires, needs and requests of those who attend and populate the Gütermarkt.
